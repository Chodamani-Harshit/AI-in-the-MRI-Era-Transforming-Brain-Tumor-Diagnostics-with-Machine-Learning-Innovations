The manual classification of brain cancers requires radiologists to possess the critical skill of evaluating medical imaging data, including MRI scans. These processes need a lot of work, take a long time, and are prone to interpretation errors, which can lead to inconsistent diagnoses. Subjective evaluation and human error are the main causes of the limitations in current diagnostic procedures. Database solutions that are scalable and objective are required. The foundation for cross-service collaboration is the integration of Taiwan's medical resources. Automating processes with machine learning is a feasible approach, and it holds great potential for enhancing diagnostic precision and automating classification. Large image libraries are used to train machine learning models, which yield consistent and dependable results that enable quicker and more precise diagnosis. This technological advancement overcomes the limits of the older me by improving medical imaging and brain tumor classification. These methods may not be able to accurately classify modest changes in the form or texture of the tumor. Moreover, conventional methods could require expertise in radiology and medical imaging, which would limit their use and expandability in clinical environments. Moreover, human feature engineering could miss important tumor characteristics or not fully utilize MRI data for classification. Moreover, human feature engineering could miss important tumor characteristics or not fully utilize MRI data for classification. The proposed method overcomes the shortcomings of current systems by automating and improving brain tumor classification from MRI imaging data using machine learning techniques. In this work, discriminating information is directly extracted from MRI scans using machine learning techniques. The suggested techniques can accurately classify brain cancers into significant categories and successfully distinguish between various tumor types by training models on large-scale MRI datasets labeled with tumor labels.
